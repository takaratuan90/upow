# Miner

Miner is a sophisticated Python-based mining client designed for participating in a distributed computing network. It connects to a mining pool, downloads computational sub-jobs, processes them, and submits the results. This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run Miner.

## Features

- Connects to a specified mining pool using WebSocket.
- Downloads and processes computational sub-jobs.
- Submits computed gradients back to the mining pool.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` for installing Python packages
- An active internet connection

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the Miner repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/upowai/miner.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Miner requires specific command-line arguments to start:

- `--MINER_POOL_IP`: The IP address of the miner pool.
- `--MINER_POOL_PORT`: The port number of the miner pool.
- `--WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your wallet address for receiving mining rewards.

## Usage

To run Miner, use the following command:

```bash
python3 miner.py --MINER_POOL_IP "127.0.0.1" --MINER_POOL_PORT 5501 --WALLET_ADDRESS "your_wallet_address"
```

Replace `"127.0.0.1"`, `5501`, and `"your_wallet_address"` with the appropriate miner pool IP, port, and your wallet address.

## Logging

Miner provides detailed logging of its operations, including connection status, job processing, and error reports. This information is crucial for monitoring the miner's performance and troubleshooting issues.

## Contributing

Contributions to Miner are welcome. Please ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
